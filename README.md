# R-ALAB-320H.9.1-Todo-List

## Description

This is a simple todo list application built with React. The app allows users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. It features a user-friendly interface with a dynamic list of todo items, and includes essential features such as:

- A heading labeling it as "Todo List."
- A list of "todo" items with:
  - A checkbox indicating whether the task is complete.
  - A "delete" button that removes a completed task.
  - An "edit" button to modify the task.
  - A text input for creating new todo items.
- Todos are added to the top of the list, and the oldest ones appear at the bottom.
- The "delete" button is only enabled once the task is marked as complete.

## Features

- **Create a New Todo**: Users can add a new todo item to the list.
- **Edit Todo**: Users can edit any todo item. While editing, the "delete" and "edit" buttons are hidden, and a "save" button appears.
- **Delete Todo**: Users can delete a todo item, but the delete button is disabled unless the task is marked as complete.
- **Mark Todo as Complete**: Users can check a box to mark a task as complete. This enables the "delete" button.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is mobile-friendly and looks great on both small and large screens.
